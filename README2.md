#GO!gym

![The GO!gym website features displayed on different devises](assets/images/responsive-test.png)

GO!gym is a gym with the purpose of motivating it’s members to attend regularly by combining as many desirable gym features in one friendly and accessible place. With this motivation, gym-goers will be more likely to keep on track and achieve their fitness goals, whatever they may be.

The website is targeted towards active individuals around the UK cities of Birmingham, Oxford or London who either aren't satisfied with their current gym and are looking for a more affordable or convenient option, or those who are looking to join a gym for the first time and may need extra support to keep on track.

Their site exists to provide relevant information to anyone who is considering switching to GO!gym or would like some further information about what they have to offer. It has been built using HTML and CSS and can be viewed on a range of devices, including those with screen-widths as low as 310 pixels, so that users are able to research GO!gym whilst on-the-go.
